# EmotionRecognitionProject

Emotion recogntion Project done under the context of my final year in the bachelor Program of Ã‰cole Polytechnique. During this project I explored the fields of Object detection and emotion recognition. 
The goal of this project was to attempt to build a model capable of predicting the emotions of characters in a sitcom, as well as their mutual relationships based
on these emotions throughout multiple episodes.
